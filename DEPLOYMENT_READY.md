## 🚀 Ready for Railway Deployment

### **Deployment Steps:**

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create Railway Project:**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository

3. **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically provide `DATABASE_URL`

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_this_in_production
   ```

5. **Deploy and Verify:**
   - Railway auto-deploys from GitHub
   - Check health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
